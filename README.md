# Welcome to Porda AI!

Introducing **Porda AI**, an innovative application designed to be your everyday AI companion, empowering the Muslim community to maintain modesty in the digital realm by blurring and covering non-mahram and haram objects in your browser.

In todayâ€™s digital landscape, encountering haram and non-mahram content in images and videos is a significant challenge. Whether browsing social media, news portals, watching documentaries, or simply surfing the web, non-mahram content can appear unexpectedly.

## Limitations

ðŸ”˜ Initially, we focused on publishing the project as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), so there are some limitations.
ðŸ”˜ We've prioritized detecting common objects first. As a result, the extension may not accurately detect more complex objects.
ðŸ”˜ The extension works well with images, but video detection may not be perfect for every frame. You can turn off video detection if needed.
ðŸ”˜ The extension works on most websites, but there are a few where it may not function correctly. Detection can be turned off on those sites.
ðŸ”˜ For Android, a third-party app (Kiwi) is needed, which may limit functionality. We are actively developing a dedicated version for Android.
ðŸ”˜ We are actively working to resolve these issues and regularly update the extension to improve its performance.
